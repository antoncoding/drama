Pizzino is a browser designed for on-chain messages. Made with ðŸ’—.

## Why is it called "Pizzino"

Pizzino is an Italian word, meaning "small piece of paper", refers to small slips of paper that the Sicilian Mafia uses for secret communications.

Now with the technology of blockchain, we can communicate with no middle man, encrypted or publicly, distinctively or anonymously, somehow just like the old-time mafias, but cooler in a geeky way.
